MyBB has been making some changes lately, and if you haven't noticed we're here to give you the scoop. Discussion about bridging 1.x closer to 2.0 has been dying down, and as such we have decided on the best course of action moving forward. This comes with some other updates, including the main site going responsive, our blog getting way more fun, setting up an official demo site, and speeding up that darn extension approval process.

Sometimes it may seem that we don't listen to the community. This couldn't be farther from the truth, we love reading what people have to say and take it all into consideration. If you'd like to have a quick discussion with us, please hop on Discord and let us know all about it!

### MyBB.com
If you've browsed our site lately on mobile, you may have noticed that it can be a real pain to navigate. We believe it is time to change that. Rather than awaiting MyBB 2 to bring our website into the modern age, you can expect it to be updated **_very_** soon. The new site will feature a few things:
* Modern Design
  <span style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; opacity: .7;">We are making sure to get the site up to modern design standards.</span>
* Fully Responsive
  <span style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; opacity: .7;">This is part of a larger goal to get all MyBB products responsive, we're starting with the main site.</span>
* SEO
  <span style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 10px; display: block; opacity: .7;">Finding pages on MyBB should be a much better experience through search engines.</span>

If you have some time and want to leave some feedback, or if you just want to look at the new design, please visit the following thread. Thanks!

### Blog
Our blog will be getting some love as well. We're now creating our blog posts via a repository on GitHub, so you can help! (Or just get a sneak peak at what the next blog will be about) If you have an idea for a blog post that we haven't done yet, or think we could be doing something better, feel free to open an issue in the repository linked below.

### Official Demo Site
You may or may not know this, but we keep the community forum as vanilla as possible so users can get a feel for what MyBB is, right out of the box. Unfortunately this limits some decisions we make where improving the community forum is concerned. Not only that, but it limits how users can explore a vanilla MyBB installation as well. We are going to be creating a demo website to solve both of these issues, allowing you as users to browse a clean installation of MyBB easily, (It will be missing a couple of features, for security reasons) as well as letting us make some quality of life improvements to our community forum. You can expect work to begin on this project after the new website has launched. Stay tuned for further updates!

### Extend Site Moderation Queue
It's no secret that getting a modification approved on the MyBB website can be a slow process. The main offender for this is our willingness to make sure submissions are safe and of good quality, which means exploring the code and installing them for ourselves. This just isn't a sustainable practice, and results in a lot of frustration.

To speed up your addon submissions, we're going to be easing our policy for allowing submissions. Modifications will be placed into their own category when they're quickly submitted, listing them as "unapproved". We will still be able to manually go through and approve them, but it won't prevent you from having your mod listed on the site.

If you find an issue with one of these unapproved addons, or even one that has been approved, please report it to us via the Private Inquiries forum so we can investigate properly.

### The future of 2.0
After a lot of discussion, both internally, on the forum and in Discord, we've decided on the path that the MyBB software will be following leading up to MyBB 2. While we can all agree that MyBB needs to be more modern, rewriting it entirely from scratch is an enormous task and is taking much longer than we anticipated. Judging from the input from users, as well as discussion among staff, our best option moving forward will be to further bridge the 1.x series toward MyBB 2, while updating it to be more usable and modern.

We have not decided on any specifics, but have discussed some of the following options:
* Use Twig
* Use Sass
* New, responsive theme
* Improved user experience, meaning changes like alerts or conversations

All that we know for now is that the MyBB 1.x line needs to be improved, and we need your help on deciding what exactly will be changing. If you'd like to join in on the discussion, head over to the forum thread we've been using to discuss the software.
