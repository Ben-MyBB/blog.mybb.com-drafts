MyBB has been making some changes lately, and if you haven't noticed we're here to give you the scoop. Discussion about bridging 1.x closer to 2.0 has been dying down, and as such we have decided on the best course of action moving forward. This comes with some other updates, including the main site going responsive, our blog getting way more fun, setting up an official demo site, and speeding up that darn extension approval process.

I'd like to say that a few members of the community did feel like the staff do not listen to the community and their suggestions. I'd like to say that is completely untrue. The staff are busy but, we are always around on things like Discord. If you haven't joined us on Discord yet, you can [do so here](https://discordapp.com/invite/rX8VpBr) which I would highly recommend doing. We tend to have some more informal chat on Discord with the team and community members coming together.

##MyBB.com
We are currently working on a new **_responsive_** design for MyBB.com (yes, you read it right, responsive!). We have shared some brief designs with the Community which you can see in the following thread and also leave any feedback that you may have!

##Blog
In regards to the MyBB Blog we are hoping to make more use of this by providing project updates and make more of the things we are working on behind the scenes public! We have created a repo on GitHub which everyone can view and open issues. If you have ideas for Blog posts that you would like to share with us open an issue on Github and we will take a look at those. Although this is a strange thing to use Github for we plan to use labels (accepted, rejected, under discussion) and we are definitely open to suggestions regardless if it is a series of blog posts or just a single post. You can find the [Github repo for this here](https://github.com/mybb/blog.mybb.com-drafts).

##Official Demo Site
It has long been one of our short falls that we haven't got a demo site set up. However, this is going to change. We currently have developed a back end script for this to be possible. Users can create a demo and this will be active for roughly 72 hours and will then expire. We have of course disabled certain features for security reasons and we are also providing a few well known plugins that you can install and see what MyBB can really do! After our new MyBB.com design has been completed our designers are going to work on the front end for our demo site so stay tuned for further updates on this!

##Extend Site Moderation Queue
We have also had users express their frustration to us about how long it takes to get a project approved onto the mods site. The reason for this is simply because we individually check each submission's code and install to ensure it works as expected. Also let's not forget the famous line that we are all volunteers! You'll be glad to know, we have came up with a solution. New submissions will no longer be placed in a moderation queue. We are in the process of modifying the current extend site to this effect and also we are placing a notice on stating that unless the project has been specifically marked as reviewed by the team then we cannot take any responsibility for submissions. Although, if you do have an issue which is published in our extend site you can report this to use through the Private Inquiries forum or by reporting the project directly on the extend site. We will then check the project and if needed, remove the project from the extend site.

##The future of 2.0
I'm not able to go into great detail on this one as this is very much 'up in the air' and we are still discussing things with a public poll and gathering the opinions of the community. The current plan is to develop 1.8 further and develop it into 2.0 gradually.
