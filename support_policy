After listening to feedback the community has recently provided us with we have created an internal RFC and the team voted to change the support eligibility policy.

What are the policy changes?
Under the updated policy we would still deny support for the below.

Illegal and unethical activity including, but not limited to unlawful distribution of intellectual property, license violations, propagating hateful content and materials endangering privacy, safety and security

Please see the updated Support PolicyÂ which has been updated to reflect the changes which we have made.

Are you currently denied support?
If you are currently denied support and it is no longer correct due to the policy updates then get in touch through the Private Enquiries forum and the team will look into this. It would be helpful if you could provide us with your board URL so we can check that you now fully comply with the updated policy.
