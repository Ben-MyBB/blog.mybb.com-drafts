# MyBB 1.9 Development Update #2

Development work on MyBB 1.9 is progressing nicely, and in this post I want to give a rundown of what has been achieved so far and what we have left to do.

## Twig Conversion

When we set out to work on MyBB 1.9, we knew that one of the biggest tasks would be [converting the existing templates into Twig templates](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/2972). This process required both creating new Twig template files, and modifying the backend code to load and render these templates rather than loading templates from the database.

This was a long process that began around the start of January and slowly built up momentum until reaching where it stands today with almost every template converted.

During this conversion process, we started picking out a list of useful Twig functions that should be added by way of new custom twig extensions. For example, the `my_date()` and `my_number_format()` functions are often used throughout the core and moving them into templates should offer template designers much more control over how data is formatted and displayed. The work on this effort is being tracked in [an issue over here](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/2976) and there is currently [an open Pull Request](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/pull/3274) to add some of the functions we've discovered so far.

## New Responsive Theme

Whilst we worked on converting templates to the Twig language, Justin has been hard at work on designing the new responsive theme. Rather than waiting for the rest of the team to convert all templates, Justin has been designing against a stock install of MyBB 1.8.15 and his current design [can currently be found on his live website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180627194402/http://mybb.jsoltesz.com/mybb-theme/).

With the template conversion now having been all but completed, Justin has began the process of integrating the required template changes for the new theme [into the main 1.9 branch](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/f2910425b6dfbb16c42a819a6863f658363571c9).

## JavaScript changes and improvements

As we're overhauling templates, we've decided that we should take a look at improving the JavaScript situation in MyBB. We want to reach a point where there is no JS code embedded within any core templates or core PHP code. [Eric made a start](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/be8b1e68ad92316527150f88692e05258ebfe091) to this process by rethinking how the code fo collapsing forums and other elements works, and we're currently [tracking the issue here](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/3282).

## Integrating SwiftMailer in place of the old mail handler code

There have been no shortage of support threads over the years related to the mail system within MyBB. Most cases have been related to the SMTP mail handler which is quite complex and has some odd edge cases causing it to simply not work with some SMTP hosts out there.

Rather than spending effort trying to rework the SMTP mail handler, it was decided that we should instead look to third parties to take that effort off our hands. We ended up choosing to use [the SwiftMailer library](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com) to handle the sending of emails due to how well supported it is.

Moving to SwiftMailer also opens up future opportunities for improvements to the emails that MyBB sends, such as:

- Adding attachments to emails
- Embedding attachments such as images within emails
- Using `CC` and `BCC` with emails
- Signing and encrypting emails with `S/MIME`
- The ability to easily add new mail transports such as transports that use HTTP based APIs such as those provided by MailGun

There's currently [an open Pull Request](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/pull/3265) to integrate this library that is extremely near completion (though it currently lacks error handling for when the sending of an email fails).

Originally we planned a more major overhaul of the mail system in order to add the ability to retry sending failed emails and improve the way that the mail queue works, but that work is being postponed for a future feature release such as MyBB 1.10. Most plugins and places in the core interact with the mail system using the `my_mail()` function as it stands, so making under the hood changes shouldn't cause too many issues.
