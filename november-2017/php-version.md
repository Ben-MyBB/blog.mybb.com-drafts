### Upcoming Changes to The Minimum PHP Version in MyBB 1.8.XX and 1.10+
Frequent visitors to the MyBB Community Forums may remember a discussion from July 2016 regarding the minimum PHP version required to use MyBB 2.0, if not, you can find that discussion [here](https://community.mybb.com/thread-195675.html). The benefits of such a change were detailed in great length by [Devilshakerz](https://community.mybb.com/user-47371.html) but with the recent announcement of the 1.10 series and the uncertainty surrounding *exactly* what is happening to MyBB 2.0 we believe that changes could and *should* happen as soon as 1.10 or even 1.8.XX. At the time of writing this blog post the current stable release of MyBB is 1.8.13 and the minimum supported PHP version is 5.2. To put that into some perspective: PHP 5.2 was released on the 2nd of November 2006 and was then declared EOL (end-of-life) on the 6th January 2011. PHP 5.2 has served us well but has not received any performance or security updates in over 6 years, it actively hinders the development and modernisation of MyBB as a whole.

Our proposal is to raise the minimum PHP version requirement to either 5.6 or 7.0, although that exact version hasn't been decided yet. PHP 5.6 still has just over a year until it reaches EOL, becoming so on the 31st of December 2018. Another suggested pathway has been to leave the 1.8 series where it is, supporting PHP 5.2 indefinitely and instead pushing for PHP 7.0 as the requirement for the 1.10 series and even further aggresive version bumping at the eventual 2.0 development and release cycle.
