The community spoke and we are listening.

Effective immediately, the MyBB team will be putting 2.0 on hold and working towards a more viable & gradual approach to rewriting the core software.  Rather than a total rewrite all at once that could take years to complete, we're going to roll out smaller updates in a quicker fashion.  Starting with MyBB 1.9 and onwards, each release (1.10, 1.11, 1.12, etc.) will have new features and rewritten code until we reach the ultimate goal of a totally rewritten and modern forum software.

First up is MyBB 1.9.  This update will feature a responsive theme built on a new and improved, [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) template system. This system will allow template conditionals, variable loops, template includes, and much more.  We're also reworking all of the javascript code and moving it from being inline with the theme to external files.  Doing this will make it easier to manage and allow us site owners to easily implement better content security policies with their forum.

We are excited to embark on this path together with the end goal being to restore MyBB's place as the best forum software available todayâ€” free or commercial.

Thank you for you feedback. Please continue to voice your opinion about the things that are important to you. We are all in this together!
