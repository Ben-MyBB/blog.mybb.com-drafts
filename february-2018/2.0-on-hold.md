The community spoke and we are listening.

Effective immediately, the main priority for MyBB will be the completion and release of MyBB 1.9. This update will feature a responsive theme built on a new and improved, Twig template system. This system will allow template conditionals, variable loops, template includes, and much more.

We are excited to embark on this path together with the end goal being to restore MyBB's place as the best forum software available todayâ€” free or commercial.

Thank you for you feedback. Please continue to voice your opinion about the things that are important to you. We are all in this together!
